Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: Java doesn't allow us to do this, because if we create a constructor method to build a DVD by title and also one to build a DVD by category so that means they have the same signatures, we can fix this by change the parameter types such as creating a constructor method to build a DVD by title and category.
